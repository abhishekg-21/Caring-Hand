          The youth comprises over one-third of the Indian population which in
          turn constitutes a major part of the labour force of the country. A
          country like India which has a huge young population can reap better
          benefits from the demographic dividend if its youth are better skilled
          and employable. It is crucial for the energy of the underprivileged
          youth to be channelized properly with proper direction to aid economic
          growth and nation building.

          Smile Foundation through its Livelihood programme connects the
          unemployed or underemployed youth from disadvantaged groups and
          communities with the sectors which have large growth potential in
          terms of revenue generation and employability. The staggering youth
          population underutilised in the job market because of a lack of
          requisite qualifications and training are upskilled, uplifted, and
          mainstreamed to become a part of the country’s growth story. The
          livelihood programme aims to complement the government’s vision and
          efforts under the Skill India mission, and is aligned with the
          Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 8.
